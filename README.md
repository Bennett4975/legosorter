# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Welcome to my LEGO building app
Short introductory and guide on how to go about using the app

What is this?
This is an application to help you to sort your mixed up LEGO peices into their original sets.

What do I do?
Step 1:
Go to "Search Set" and add every set you know that you own. I would advise doing this searching the set number of each instruction manual you have. Otherwise, it's up to your own memory

Step 2:
Now that your sets are logged, you must piece by piece log a lego part by using "Search Part" and selecting it's color. All owned sets that reqiure or contain that piece be displayed. You can choose which set you would like to contribute that piece to. If no sets require the piece, you may discard it.

Step 3:
Repeat Step 2 until you no longer have any more pieces or until all sets are complete!

Tips for efficiency:
This clearly sounds like a tedious task (it very much is), but having field tested this myself, I have some tips that can make the process more efficient.

1: Start with larger chunks that are still connected together:
As your going through the LEGO "graveyard", you may find chunks parts that clearly all go to the same set. Each set has it's own page that displays all needed and owned parts which you may add and remove as you please.

If it is not initially clear which set the chunk is a part of, I would advise searching the most unusual looking part in the chunk. From there you can see if any set requires the part, and make an educated guess if the set requires two or three more of the chunks parts.

Don't select pieces randomly:
An extra step that may seem tedious at first is logging bricks categories at a time rather than all at once. What i mean by this is; Start by taking all Brick type pieces from your lego bin, putting them into another empty bin perhaps. From there you can take out every Regular Brick, log them. Then sloped, then round etc.
